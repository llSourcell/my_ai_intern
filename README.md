## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Lead Generation Process

1. **Scrape Real Estate Agents:** Uses Bright Data's MCP to pull agent data from Realtor.com and Zillow
   ```python
   # MCP servers provide stealth mode for bots - unblockable real-time web access
   # Using Bright Data's Web Unlocker to access agent listings
   agents = scrape_agents_via_mcp("Austin, TX", limit=100)
   ```

2. **Mine Buyer Intent:** Searches social media for people looking to buy/sell
   ```python
   # Search for posts like "Moving to Austin" or "Need a 3-bed in 78704"
   buyer_signals = mine_intent_signals(["twitter", "reddit", "facebook_groups"])
   ```

3. **Match Buyers to Agents:** Connects buyers with agents in the same areas
   ```python
   # Match based on zip code, property type, and specialization
   matched_leads = match_buyer_to_agent(buyer_signals, agents)
   ```

### Customize Sales Scripts

Modify the prompt in `voice.py` to change the sales approach:

```python
# Customize your sales script here
script = f"Hi {agent_name}, this is Ava from Home IQ. We've tracked {buyer_count} qualified buyers searching in {zip_code} right now. Would you like a list?"
```

## üîç Technical Details

- **Backend:** Flask, SQLite, Bright Data MCP for scraping
- **APIs:** Twilio (calls), ElevenLabs (voice), OpenAI (GPT-4 intelligence)
- **Frontend:** React with Tailwind UI
- **Performance:** Automated scheduling, call logging, analytics

### Bright Data MCP Integration

This project uses Bright Data's Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for powerful web scraping:

- **Unblockable Access:** MCP servers provide stealth mode that can bypass CAPTCHAs and blocks
- **Global Coverage:** Access data from anywhere with worldwide IP coverage
- **AI-Ready Data:** Automatically formats extracted content for AI processing
- **Dynamic Content:** Handles JavaScript-rendered content effortlessly

```javascript
// Example MCP Server connection
const SBR_CDP = 'wss://brd-customer-CUSTOMER_ID-zone-ZONE_NAME:PASSWORD@brd.superproxy.io:9222';

async function scrapeAgents() {
    const browser = await pw.chromium.connectOverCDP(SBR_CDP);
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto('https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Austin_TX/pg-1');
    // Extract agent data...
}
```

## üìä Scaling Strategies

Once your MVP is working, consider these scaling approaches:

1. **Vertical expansion:** Target different industries (e-commerce, insurance, etc.)
2. **Recurring revenue:** Convert one-time sales ($149) to subscriptions ($99/month)
3. **Self-optimization:** Let the AI improve pitches based on call outcomes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Compliance

This tool is designed with TCPA compliance in mind:
- Each call opens with a clear disclosure
- Provides opt-out options
- Logs all interactions

Always verify regulations in your region before automated calling.
